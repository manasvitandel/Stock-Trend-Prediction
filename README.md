## Final-Year-Machine-Learning-Stock-Price-Prediction-Project
Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction using LSTM project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting stock market trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. With the power of deep learning, we aim to forecast stock prices and make informed investment decisions
## StreamStockTrend 
Top Class Stock Price Prediction Project through Machine Learning Algorithms for Google. Easy Understanding and Implementation.
## StreamStockTrend Prediction:
This study investigates the historical challenges faced by us in the stock market, particularly focusing on personal obstacles such as paperwork and administrative burdens. As a student investor, navigating the complexities of the stock market often involves grappling with cumbersome paperwork requirements, including account setup forms, transaction documentation, and regulatory filings. These administrative tasks can pose significant barriers, consuming time and resources, and impeding students' ability to focus on learning and investment strategies. We implement it by machine learning-based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. Through LSTM algorithms, the LSTM-UI model generates intuitive indicators, allowing users to easily understand when to buy or hold stocks. Through empirical analysis and user testing, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the LSTM-UI framework in empowering users with accessible and actionable insights. Through qualitative analysis and experiential insights, this study explores the impact of reducing administrative burdens on learning outcomes in the stock market. We findings the user-friendly solutions to promote financial literacy and facilitate meaningful engagement in the stock market.
## Understanding the Problem Statement:
This study examines the challenges encountered by us, in participating in the stock market, with a focus on administrative hurdles such as paperwork. Historically, engaging in stock market activities has involved burdensome paperwork requirements, including account setup forms, transaction documentation, and regulatory filings. These administrative tasks often consume time and resources, detracting from the overall user experience and limiting participation in investment opportunities.
 
## Model Training üßëüèª‚Äçüíª...(Which Model Use)
The LSTM model is built using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. We train the model on the training dataset, adjusting hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the learning rate. We employ techniques like regularization and dropout to prevent overfitting.
